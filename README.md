# IQOD_Misc_18

## DO EVERYTHING MANUALLY

```
array = [2, [4, 5], 5, [2, 3], 3, [7, 5]]
```
Using the array above as an example, create a program that will multiple the first integer by the sum of the next array. Print out each set. See the examples below.

Example:

```
array = [4, [2, 3], 2, [4, 3]]
iqod(array)
```
Output:

```
20
14
```
You add 2+3 then multiple it by 4 to get 20.

Then you add 4+3 then multiple it by 2 to get 14.
